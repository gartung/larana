 * Title:   Start Position & Direction Matcher Algorithim Class
 * Author:  Justin Hugon (jhugon@fnal.gov)
 *
 * Description: Algorithm for matching MCParticles to reconstructed tracks 
 *              based on the start position and direction of the track and 
 *              MCParticle.
 * Input:       simb::MCParticle, vector<art::Ptr<recob::Track>>, and 
 *              maximum angle for match (double)
 * Output:      Matched track (art::Ptr<recob::Track>) and angle in 
 *              radians between start direction of track and MCParticle 
 *              (double)
